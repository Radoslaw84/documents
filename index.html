             <p><font color="white">The rebel forces, once a mere nuisance, have grown into sizable threats that must be put down as soon as possible. Their ability to elude us, and sympathy from their respective countries has remained their greatest advantage, but a new strategy will soon remedy this.<br>

I would like to propose a process of infiltration not merely for purposes of intelligence gathering, but also to make these rebels as much a nuisance to the public as they are to us. I am proposing sabotage of a different variety. How troublesome would it be to the Fascists of Italy or the National Democrats of Poland if one of their own instigated a riot that destroyed the businesses and homes of a city? For them to develop a reputation for violence and abuse of citizens? There are many ways this could be achieved, but the first step is infiltration. We must have several agents join the ranks of rebels in Iberia, France, Italy, and Poland posthaste.</font> </p>

             <p><font color="white">Extreme measures must be taken to keep mister Heisenberg out of the public eye, and under close protection. We are close approaching the final designs of a functional device which might put all other projects to rest.<br>
We can not stress the urgency of Heisenburg's security. Without him there is not project, and none of the other projects are capable of providing us the immediate results necessary. That said, research should continue, as while such other projects will not be ready within schedule, I suspect many of them could bear even riper fruit if we are patient.</font> </p>

             <p><font color="white">Hazards of the Bell.<br>

The Bell must be restrained at all times by steel chains measuring no less than 10 by 10 meters in length.<br>

Approach the Bell with great caution. The Bell is known to emit extreme heats reaching as high as 500 degrees. Protective clothing is recommended when the Bell is engaged. Even if there is no heat hazard, the Bell will emit bursts of radiation every half hour from activation, and each half hour following.<br>

Piloting of the Bell is forbidden until time flux has been solved.</font></p>
